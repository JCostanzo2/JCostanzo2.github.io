### Informal Code Review

[Code Review](https://youtu.be/HPM57O43frI) for the first enhancement.


This code review goes over my first artifact which is a translation of a project from java to python.

### Enhancement One

  The first artifact I chose to enhance for my ePortfolio is the project I created for the software testing, automation, and quality assurance course I took earlier in the computer science program. I chose this project, because I believe it demonstrates a good basis on my knowledge of basic coding practices while also including more intricate pieces such as software testing. The project was initially created in May of 2021 and consists of two classes that are made to hold and store data that would be used as contacts. The data held within the classes feature attributes such as phone numbers, names, and addresses. The first class holds those basic attributes while the second class is used to create a list of those contacts acting like an address book.
  
  As I said earlier, I chose this project to display my basic knowledge of programming in object-oriented languages. I believe I was successful in further proving this by transferring the code from Java to Python. I was also able to increase the efficiency of the program by shortening the number of tests required. By being able to convert code from Java to Python, I’m able to prove that I can easily read and write code in multiple coding languages and use problem solving techniques to overcome any issues that pop up from converting different libraries. When working on the enhancement of this project, I didn’t fully realize how different Python and Java were syntax wise. This led to me having to look up multiple libraries to learn which Python methods are most similar to the Java commands I used previously.


### Enhancement Two

  The second artifact I chose to enhance for my ePortfolio is the project I created for the advanced programming concepts course I took earlier in the computer science program. I chose this project, because I believe it shows that I have a decent understanding of the use of databases in programs and how to make their use simpler by creating simple programs that search through the databases faster than typing on a command line. The project was initially created in August of 2021 and consists of a class that creates, reads, updates, and deletes data within an animal shelter database. The project also holds a testing file that tests the methods in the animal shelter class. Finally, the project has an app file that creates a user interface that utilizes the methods from the animal shelter class.

  I chose this project to demonstrate my knowledge of using databases while making tools to make navigation of them faster and easier. I believe I was successful in further proving this by reworking some of the methods and adding more features to the user interface app. By being able to make my methods more efficient and adding more to the overall program, I’m able to prove that I have a decent foundation of database knowledge that shows I can make a program that creates a simpler way of navigating through a database. When working on the enhancement of this project, I was able to learn more on how to use python when working with a database and further expand my knowledge of databases due to having to look for better ways to change how my methods operate.


### Enhancement Three

  The third artifact I chose to enhance for my ePortfolio is the final project I put together for the fundamentals of data mining course I took earlier in the computer science program. I chose this project, because I believe it demonstrates my understanding of the use of data mining and how to use the various tools provided by data mining to describe what different data means and how to come up with new ideas to further improve what the data was initially for. The project was created in August of 2021.
  
  I chose this project to demonstrate my knowledge of using databases and how to use data mining as a tool to use data in a way that can improve production or sales. I believe I was successful in further proving this by adding additional data mining techniques to drive my previous research farther. By looking at different charts and providing more context to previously used ones, I believe I was able to improve my previous work and extend the value it brings by further proving how certain data like age and income can be a determining factor for sales in a webstore. When working on the enhancement of this project, I was able to learn more about how to use different data mining research to properly explain how data can be best used for improved success.
